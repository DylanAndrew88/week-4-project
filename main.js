// 1. First select and store the elements you'll be working with


// 2. Create your `onSubmit` event for getting the user's search term


// 3. Create your `fetch` request that is called after a submission


// 4. Create a way to append the fetch results to your page


// 5. Create a way to listen for a click that will play the song in the audio play

function searchTracks() {
  let string = searchBar.value;
  fetch('https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/?client_id=095fe1dcd09eb3d0e1d3d89c76f5618f&q=' + string)
  .then(
    function(response) {
      if(response.status !== 200) {
        console.log('Looks like there was a problem. Status Code: ' + response.status);
        return
      }
      response.json().then(function(data) {
      }})}
